## Requirements

-   [Docker][docker] Version 2.0.0.3 (31259) or higher, installed, running, and signed in. If you're on **Windows**, check out [this link][wsl] to get set up in WSL.
-   [Plaid API keys][plaid-keys] - [sign up][plaid-signup] for a free Sandbox account if you don't already have one
- An [ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken). If you don't already have an ngrok account, you can [sign up for free](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup).

## Getting Started

Note: We recommend running these commands in a unix terminal. Windows users can use a [WSL][wsl] terminal to access libraries like `make`.

1. Clone the repo.
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/plaid/payment-initiation-pattern-app.git
    cd payment-initiation-pattern-app
    ```
1. Create the `.env` file.
    ```shell
    cp .env.template .env
    ```
1. Update the `.env` file with your [Plaid API keys][plaid-keys] and, if you are testing OAuth, OAuth redirect uri (in sandbox this is `http://localhost:3002/oauth-link`).

1. Update the `ngrok.yml` file in the ngrok folder with your [ngrok authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken). 

1. If you have entered an optional OAuth redirect uri in the .env file, you will also need to configure an allowed redirect URI for your client ID through the [Plaid developer dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/api).

1. Verify Payment Initiation is enabled for your client ID through the Plaid Developer Dashboard ([Development](https://dashboard.plaid.com/overview/development), [Sandbox](https://dashboard.plaid.com/overview/sandbox) and [Production](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products)). If it is not enabled, contact your Plaid Account Executive or Account Manager to enable your client ID for the Payment Initiation product.

1. Start the services. The first run may take a few minutes as Docker images are pulled/built for the first time.
    ```shell
    make start
    ```
1. Open http://localhost:3002 in a web browser.
1. View the logs
    ```shell
    make logs
    ```
1. When you're finished, stop the services.
    ```shell
    make stop
    ```

## Additional Commands

All available commands can be seen by calling `make help`.

## Architecture

As a modern full-stack application, Pattern consists of multiple services handling different segments of the stack:

-   [`client`][client-readme] runs a [React]-based single-page web frontend
-   [`server`][server-readme] runs an application back-end server using [NodeJS] and [Express]
-   [`database`][database-readme] runs a [PostgreSQL][postgres] database
-   [`ngrok`][ngrok-readme] exposes a [ngrok] tunnel from your local machine to the Internet to receive webhooks

We use [Docker Compose][docker-compose] to orchestrate these services. As such, each individual service has its own Dockerfile, which Docker Compose reads when bringing up the services.

More information about the individual services is given below.

# Plaid Pattern Europe - Client

The Pattern web client is written in JavaScript using [React]. It presents an example account funding workflow to the user, including an implementation of [OAuth][plaid-oauth]. The app runs on port 3002 by default, although you can modify this in [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml).

## Key concepts

### Communicating with the server

Aside from websocket listeners (see below), all HTTP calls to the Pattern server are defined in `src/services/api.js`.

### Webhooks and Websockets

The Pattern server is configured to send a message over a websocket whenever it receives a webhook from Plaid. On the client side websocket listeners are defined in `src/components/Sockets.jsx` that wait for these messages and update data in real time accordingly.

# Plaid Pattern Europe - Server

The application server is written in JavaScript using [Node.js][nodejs] and [Express][expressjs]. It interacts with the Plaid API via the [Plaid Node SDK][plaid-node], and with the [database][database-readme] using [`node-postgres`][node-pg]. While we've used Node for the reference implementation, the concepts shown here will apply no matter what language your backend is written in.

## Key Concepts

### Using webhooks

For webhooks to work, the server must be publicly accessible on the internet. For development purposes, this application uses [ngrok][ngrok-readme] to accomplish that. The ngrok session is only valid for 2 hours and the server must be re-started after that.

### Testing OAuth

A redirect_uri parameter is included in the linkTokenCreate call and set in this sample app to the PLAID_SANDBOX_REDIRECT_URI you have set in the .env file (`http://localhost:3002/oauth-link`). This is the page that the user will be redirected to upon completion of the OAuth flow at their OAuth institution when using a non-popup OAuth flow, such as when using mobile webviews. To test this flow, you will also need to configure `http://localhost:3002/oauth-link` as an allowed redirect URI for your client ID through the [Plaid developer dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/api).

For more details on testing OAuth, see [Testing OAuth](https://plaid.com/docs/link/oauth/#testing-oauth).

If you want to test an OAuth redirect uri in development, you need to use https and set `PLAID_REDIRECT_URI=https://localhost:3002/oauth-link` in `.env`. In order to run your localhost on https, you will need to create a self-signed certificate and add it to the client root folder. MacOS users can use the following instructions to do this. Note that self-signed certificates should be used for testing purposes only, never for actual deployments. Windows users can use [these instructions below](#windows-instructions-for-using-https-with-localhost).

#### MacOS instructions for using https with localhost

If you are using MacOS, in your terminal, change to the client folder:

```bash
cd client
```

Use homebrew to install mkcert:

```bash
brew install mkcert
```

Then create your certificate for localhost:

```bash
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost
```

This will create a certificate file localhost.pem and a key file localhost-key.pem inside your client folder.

Then in the package.json file in the client folder, replace this line on line 26

```bash
"start": "PORT=3002 react-scripts start",
```

with this line instead:

```bash
"start": "PORT=3002 HTTPS=true SSL_CRT_FILE=localhost.pem SSL_KEY_FILE=localhost-key.pem react-scripts start",
```

Finally, in the wait-for-client.sh file in the server folder, replace this line on line 6

```bash
while [ "$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -m 1 localhost:3002)" != "200" ]
```

with this line instead:

```bash
while [ "$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -m 1 https://localhost:3002)" != "200" ]
```

After starting up the Pattern sample app, you can now view it at https://localhost:3002.

#### Windows instructions for using https with localhost

If you are on a Windows machine, in the package.json file in the client folder, replace this line on line 26

```bash
"start": "PORT=3002 react-scripts start",
```

with this line instead:

```bash
"start": "PORT=3002 HTTPS=true react-scripts start",
```

Then, in the wait-for-client.sh file in the server folder, replace this line on line 6

```bash
while [ "$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -m 1 localhost:3002)" != "200" ]
```

with this line instead:

```bash
while [ "$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -m 1 https://localhost:3002)" != "200" ]
```

After starting up the Pattern sample app, you can now view it at https://localhost:3002. Your browser will alert you with an invalid certificate warning; click on "advanced" and proceed.

## Debugging

The node debugging port (9229) is exposed locally on port 9229.

If you are using Visual Studio Code as your editor, you can use the `Docker: Attach to Server` launch configuration to interactively debug the server while it's running. See the [VS Code docs][vscode-debugging] for more information.

# Plaid Pattern - Database

The database is a [PostgreSQL][postgres] instance running inside a Docker container.

Port 5432 is exposed to the Docker host, so you can connect to the DB using the tool of your choice.
Username and password can be found in [docker-compose.yml][docker-compose].

To clear all the data in the database, enter into the terminal:

```bash
make clear-db
```

## Key Concepts

## Tables

The `*.sql` scripts in the `init` directory are used to initialize the database if the data directory is empty (i.e. on first run, after manually clearing the db by running `make clear-db`, or after modifying the scripts in the `init` directory).

See the [create.sql][create-script] initialization script to see some brief notes for and the schemas of the tables used in this application.

# Plaid Pattern Europe - ngrok

This demo includes [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), a utility that creates a secure tunnel between your local machine and the outside world. We're using it here to expose the local webhooks endpoint to the internet.

Browse to [localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040/inspect/http) to see the ngrok dashboard. This will show any traffic that gets routed through the ngrok URL.

**Do NOT use ngrok in production!** It's only included here as a convenience for local development and is not meant to be a production-quality solution.

Donâ€™t want to use ngrok? As long as you serve the app with an endpoint that is publicly exposed, all the Plaid webhooks will work.

ngrok's free account has a session limit of 2 hours. To fully test out some of the transaction webhook workflows, you will need to get a more persistent endpoint as noted above when using the development environment.
